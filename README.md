Welcome to my world.

I’m a Software Engineer & LLM Designer—crafting AI platforms, distributed systems, and creative tools at the intersection of code and imagination.

Currently building TerraLambda (serverless magic), Gomon(Go monitoring like a ninja) and Noodl (mindmapping meets AI creativity).

Code. Design. Repeat.
